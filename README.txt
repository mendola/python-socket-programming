This directory includes four programs: A TCP client and server, and a UDP
client and server. Currently, the server IP address is hard-coded in both
client programs. To run, a client and server, replace the IP address in 
the client program with the IP address of the server machine, and run with
python3 (3.5 or newer).

The server allows the client to request a currency conversion rate. From 
the client, enter '?' for help.
